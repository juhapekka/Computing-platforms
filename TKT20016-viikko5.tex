\exercise{1}
\textbf{Synchronous and asynchronous communication.} In
synchronous communication both communicating parties are
expected to be present at the same time, while
in asynchronous communication they can run separate times.


\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{\makebox[1cm][l]{\Huge\text{(\stylishfont\alph*)}}}, leftmargin=!, labelindent=0pt]
  \item What if your application logic needs synchronous
  communication, but the environment only provide asynchronous
  communication? How can you use asynchronous communication to
  implement synchronous communication?\newline

  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Sending a Request:} The sender dispatches
    a message asynchronously to the receiver.
    \item \textbf{Attaching an Identifier:} Include a unique
    identifier with the message so that the corresponding
    response can be recognized.
    \item \textbf{Blocking for the Response:} The sender then
    waits (i.e., blocks) until it receives a reply matching
    the identifier. This wait can be implemented using
    mechanisms such as callbacks or condition variables.
    \item \textbf{Resuming Execution:} Once the response is
    received, the sender unblocks and continues execution.
  \end{itemize}


This approach creates request-response (synchronous) pattern
over asynchronous channel, ensuring the sender does not proceed
until the required information is available.\newline




  \item Think about a reverse situation.
  You need asynchronous communication, but only synchronous
  communication is available? How can you implement
  asynchronous communication using synchronous communication?\newline

  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Using Concurrency:} Spawn separate thread or process
    to handle the synchronous communication. Main thread can continue
    execution without waiting.
    \item \textbf{Buffering Messages:} Create local message queue or
    buffer where outgoing messages are stored. Dedicated worker thread
    performs synchronous send/receive operations behalf of main
    application.
    \item \textbf{Event-Driven Notification:} On completing synchronous
    operation, worker thread notify main thread (e.g., via 
    event or callback mechanism) that communication is complete,
    thus decoupling the communication from main control flow.
  \end{itemize}

By offloading the blocking operations to separate threads and using
buffering, overall system behaves in an asynchronous manner despite
underlying synchronous primitives.

\end{enumerate}

\exercise{2}
You have an existing program that uses pipes (named or unnamed) as communication mechanism
between two processes. Now you need to move one of the processes to another computer and
you need to change the communication mechanism, because pipes can be used only within one
computer. Which of the mechanisms (shared memory, signal, file, socket, message queue, remote
procedure call) would you be able to use and why? Please also give reasons for the rest, why
they would not be suitable in this case.

\subsection*{Suitable mechanisms}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Socket:} Sockets are designed for network communication.
    They allow data to be transmitted between processes on
    different computers reliably and efficiently.
    \item \textbf{Message Queue:} Distributed message queue systems
    enable asynchronous communication across machines. They provide
    buffering, reliability, and decoupling of processes.
    \item \textbf{Remote Procedure Call (RPC):} RPC abstracts network
    communication details and allows a process to invoke functions
    on a remote machine. It encapsulates the network protocols and
    provides a clean interface for inter-machine communication.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Not suitable mechanisms:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Shared Memory:} Shared memory is based on idea
    of multiple processes accessing common memory space, which is
    only feasible on the same physical computer.
    \item \textbf{Signal:} Signals are primarily used for simple
    notifications or process control within a single machine.
    They do not carry amount of data or offer reliability needed
    for communication across different machines.
    \item \textbf{File:} While files can be used for communication
    via a shared network file system, this approach is prone
    to synchronization issues. File-based communication is less
    suitable for real-time or interactive inter-process communication.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Race condition.} Alice and Bob come to run 4000 meters on a running track that is 400 meters
long. The python code “race-condition.py” shows how they are counting the laps. Download the
code separately from Moodle.

\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{\makebox[1cm][l]{\Huge\text{(\stylishfont\alph*)}}}, leftmargin=!, labelindent=0pt]
  \item Run the code several times on your computer.
  What do you observe?\newline
  
  \item Determine the proper lower and upper bound on the final value
  of the shared variable laps when this concurrent program terminates.
  Assume threads can execute at any relative speed.
