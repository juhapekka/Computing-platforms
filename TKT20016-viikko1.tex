Process creation and termination.
\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{\alph*})]
    \item
    \textbf{Briefly describe what happens when a process is created?}

    Process creation involves several well defined steps to prepare a new
    process for execution. According to Stallings\cite{stallings}, the general
    steps for process creation are as follows:
    
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{\arabic*.}]
        \item \textbf{Assign a unique identifier:} Each created process is given an unique
        identifier. This is added to the process table, which has an entry for each process.
    
        \item \textbf{Allocate space:} Memory is allocated for the process'es image,
        including program, data, and stack. If the process inherit memory or
        resources from a parent process, the appropriate linkages are set up.
    
        \item \textbf{Initialize process control block content:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Identification portion, contain such as PID and parent PID.
            \item Processor state, being mostly zero except for program counter and stack pointers.
            \item Control information, such as the initial state
            (Ready or Ready/Suspend) and priority.
        \end{itemize}
    
        \item \textbf{Set scheduling linkages:} The process is added to
        appropriate scheduling queue such as the Ready queue or Ready/Suspend queue.
    
        \item \textbf{Create or expand other data structures:} Accounting files and
        other structures are initialized for monitoring, billing, or performance evaluation.
    \end{enumerate}
        

    \pagebreak
    \item
    \textbf{List and describe three different reasons leading to process termination}

    Processes in an operating system can terminate for various reasons.
    Below are three common causes, along with their descriptions and examples in MacOS:

\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{\arabic*.}]
    \item \textbf{Normal Completion}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Description:} A process terminates normally when
        it successfully completes the execution of its program.
        \item \textbf{Example:} In MacOS, a process calls the \texttt{exit()}
        system call to signal successful completion. The operating system cleans
        up resources and notifies the parent process.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Error or Exception}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Description:} Processes terminate abnormally due to
        runtime errors or exceptions such as division by zero or segmentation faults.
        \item \textbf{Example:} In MacOS, dereferencing a null pointer results
        in a segmentation fault terminating the process.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{External Termination (Kill or Signal)}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Description:} A process is terminated by an external factor, such as:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item A parent process sending a termination signal (\texttt{SIGKILL}, \texttt{SIGTERM}).
            \item System-initiated termination during shutdown or when resources are insufficient (For example OOM-killer).
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Example:} Using the \texttt{kill} command to send a \texttt{SIGKILL} signal:
        \begin{lstlisting}[
            style=pidstyle
        ]
        kill -9 <PID>
        \end{lstlisting}
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\exercise{3}

\textbf{Context switch on the TOY processor.}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{\alph*})]
    \item \textbf{What information about the context of a process needs to be saved to the process control block (PCB) during a mode switch?}
    
    When a mode switch occurs, the operating system must save the current context of the process to its PCB to ensure it can resume execution later. The following information is saved:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item General-purpose registers R0 .. R3: These contain the current working
        data of the process.
        \item Special registers:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item SP (Stack Pointer): Tracks the top of the user process's stack.
            \item FP (Frame Pointer): Tracks the base of the current stack frame.
            \item PC (Program Counter): Indicates the next instruction to be executed.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Process priority, execution state, and any information required
        for scheduling or resource management.
    \end{itemize}


    \item \textbf{What happens during a mode switch when an interrupt occurs?}

    When an interrupt occurs, the TOY processor performs the following steps:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Save the Program Counter (PC): The address of the next instruction
        in the user process is saved to the \textbf{EPC} register.
        \item Load Interrupt Handler Address: Address of interrupt
        handler is loaded into the \textbf{PC} register, switching execution
        to interrupt handler.
        \item Switch to System Mode: Processor changes its mode from user to system,
        enabling access to all registers, including \textbf{K0} and \textbf{K1}.
        \item Execute Interrupt Handler: Processor begin executing
        instructions from interrupt handler.
    \end{enumerate}

    \item \textbf{What happens during a mode switch when the operating system returns to the interrupted process?}

    After interrupt is handled operating system restores the context of
    interrupted process:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Restore PC: Address saved in the \textbf{EPC} register in part b
        is copied back to the \textbf{PC} register.
        \item Switch to User Mode: Processor changes mode from system to user, restricting access to \textbf{EPC}, \textbf{K0}, and \textbf{K1}.
        \item Resume Execution: Process continues execution from  address now stored in the \textbf{PC} register, resuming where it was interrupted.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

        \item
        {\bf Now run with these flags: ./process-run.py

        As it's seen in results, second PID get to execute
        after first PID and will be blocked while IO is in
        progress. Both processes complete after 11 cycles.

\exercise{5}
\textbf{Processes and process states (cont‚Äôd)}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{\arabic*}), start=3]
    \item
    {\bf Switch the order of the processes: -l
    1:0,4:100. What happens now?}

    Now first PID get blocked when it start to do I/O which
    follow there's context switch to second PID which get to
    use CPU. This interleaves two processes making overall
    process faster. Now both PIDs finish in 7 cycles instead of
    previously seen 11 cycles.

    \item
    {\bf We‚Äôll now explore some of the other flags. What happens
    when you run the following two processes (-l 1:0,4:100
    -c \linebreak -S SWITCH\_ON\_END), one doing I/O and the
    other doing CPU work?}

    Now context switching is blocked until one PID is finished,
    this cause second PID to wait until I/O on first PID is
    finished. Effect of this for final result is overall process
    take 11 cycles, e.g. same as seen in {\bf 2)}.

    \item
    {\bf Now, run the same processes, but with the switching
    behavior set to switch to another process whenever one
    is WAITING for I/O (-l 1:0,4:100 -c -S SWITCH\_ON\_IO).
    What happens now?}

    Now we see same result as on {\bf 3)}, ie. while PID become
    blocked by I/O another PID will be switched on to.
\pagebreak
    \item 
    {\bf  One other important behavior is what to do when
    an I/O completes. What happens when you run this combination
    of processes? (./process-run.py -l 3:0,5:100,5:100,5:100
    -S SWITCH\_ON\_IO -c -p -I IO\_RUN\_LATER). Are system
    resources being effectively utilized?}

    No, system resources are not being effectively utilized.
    This can be seen from table below where interleaving
    CPU and I/O is not perfect:

    {\scriptsize

    {\bf Now run the same processes, but with
    -I IO\_RUN\_IMMEDIATE set, which immediately runs
    the process that issued the I/O. How does this behavior
    differ? Why might running a process that just completed
    an I/O again be a good idea?}

    Now interleaving of PIDs is well aligned which is seen at 100\% CPU
    utilization. Swtiching to process that just completed I/O maybe good
    idea if it has more I/O operations in queue. This will allow slow I/O
    operations to be running continuously.
